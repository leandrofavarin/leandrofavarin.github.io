I'm the Head of Mobile Engineering at [hibooks](https://www.hibooks.com/). I grew up in SÃ£o Paulo and previously studied Electrical Engineering at Unicamp, [one of the best](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/brics-rankings/2014/) and [most prestigious](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/latin-america-university-rankings/) university in Latin America.

Previously, I lead the Android team at [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/). I discovered my passion in coding in school, where I helped organize workshops to program robots using [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)).

I currently live in Berlin, which is now my favorite city. Its [message](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html) for me is: be **creative**. Build. And I love **building** things. I also love to **learn**, particularly different ways of being and thinking. For that I read several non-fiction books in order to grow and expand my mind. See my [bookshelf](/bookshelf).

Nowadays I'm aiming to be the best Kotlin engineer. Also into cooking **plant-based** meals.

Feel free to [email](mailto:lfavarin+site@gmail.com?subject=Hi!) me, or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/leandrofavarin/), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leandrofavarin/), and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrofavarin/).
